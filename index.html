      <u>A New Career Awaits!</u>
    </h2>
    <p>
      My career experiences and skills have grown from my childhood hobbies - I was an avid reader, a writer, an illustrator, thinker, and a tinkerer. From a young age, I always tried to discover how things worked by taking them apart and assembling back together again, often to the chagrin of my elders. But such curiosity served me well; I turned it toward academic pursuits where I earned a dual major in Philosophy and English.
    </p>
    <p>
      I started out as a teacher and later moved into fundraising, where I worked for over a decade raising money for scholarships and bringing together students and alumni. Although personally fulfilling, I still had a desire to work in an industry where I could utilize my creativity and fulfill my desire to find solutions to existing problems. While working at St. Johnâ€™s University, I had the opportunity to play with the SQL database we used to track gifts from alumni. I was able to compile that information in a variety of useful ways, allowing us to focus our fundraising efforts on the most engaged alumni and increasing small gifts.
    </p>
    <p>
      Curious about how much further I could take that experience, I began exploring computer programming as an outlet for my desire to solve problems and create new ways of handling information. And so now I look forward to starting a new chapter of my life as a fullstack developer!
