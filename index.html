    <p>
      My name is Gregory, and I am pursuing a career as a full stack engineer! Looking for a change, I decided to start following in my father's footsteps, as he was an accountant turned coder who went on to have a fulfilling careeer. I decided I would being by learning JavaScript and SQL, in addition to HTML and CSS.
